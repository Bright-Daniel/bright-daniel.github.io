									<h2>Project:Data Exploration on Loan Data from Prosper</h2>
									<p>Loan Data from Prosper contains 113,937 loan transactions with 81 variables on each loan, including loan original amount,various features of borrowers, current loan status and many others.For this project, I focused on the borrowers' features(being a home owner,having a verifiable source of income and currently being in a group) to determine their credit worthiness. I compared these attributes of the borrowers to the Loan Statues, Prosper Score(risk ranking from 1-10) and the Original amount of loan collected. I started by looking at the distribution of theses variables individually then moved to comparing them pairs after which I compared them in three's. Athough no system is 100% efficient as a saying goes but these attributes are good and effective in determimng the credit worthiness of a borrower. I strongly recommend that care should be taken while using these features because borrowers' behaviour meant differ. Click below to know more about this project.</p>
